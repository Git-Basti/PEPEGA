# PEPEGA
This is a Custom Bot for the TheDeLorian Community Discord Server (German)

# How to Use
You have to create a Discord application and copy the Bot TOKEN !! DON'T SHARE IT !! and save it in an .env file as follows:

DISCORD_TOKEN=-Paste here your TOKEN-

To ensure that the slash commands are immediately ready for testing, I sync a special guild (server ID), 
which means that in my test server I can immediately use the slash commands after restarting the bot.

To set this up, you simply need to enter the GUILD_ID of your server after the DISCORD_TOKEN.
You get the Guild ID with activated Discord Developer Mode, which you can simply activate in the Discord settings under Advanced.
After that right click on the server icon and at the bottom you can copy the server ID

the .env file should then contain the following

DISCORD_TOKEN=-Paste here your TOKEN-
GUILD_ID=-Paste here your ID-

If you still get an error contact me
